Executing: Set up a Supabase database:

To set up a Supabase database, follow these steps:

Create a Supabase account by visiting the Supabase website (https://supabase.io/) and signing up for an account.
Once you have created an account, log in to the Supabase dashboard.
Click on the "New Project" button to create a new project.
Provide a name for your project and choose an appropriate region for your database.
After creating the project, you will be redirected to the project dashboard.
In the left sidebar, click on the "Database" tab to access the database settings.
Click on the "Create Table" button to create a new table.
Give the table a name, such as "products," and define the necessary columns for storing product information (e.g., name, description, price, etc.).
Repeat the process to create additional tables for storing customer data and sales information, if required.
Once you have created the necessary tables, you can start inserting data into them by clicking on the "Insert Row" button for each table.
Enter the relevant data for each row and save the changes.
You can also modify the table structure by adding or removing columns as needed.
To retrieve data from the Supabase database, you can use the Supabase JavaScript SDK in your PWA code.
Install the Supabase JavaScript SDK by running the following command in your project directory:
Copy Code
npm install @supabase/supabase-js

Import the Supabase client in your JavaScript code:
Javascript
Copy Code
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

Create a Supabase client instance by providing your Supabase project URL and API key:
Javascript
Copy Code
const supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
const supabaseKey = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_API_KEY';
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);

You can now use the Supabase client to perform database operations, such as querying data or inserting new rows. For example, to fetch all products from the "products" table:
Javascript
Copy Code
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('products').select('*');

Make sure to handle any errors and process the retrieved data as needed in your PWA code.

By following these steps, you have successfully set up a Supabase database for your PWA. You can now start storing and retrieving data from the database to provide a seamless shopping experience to your customers.

üíª Writing code...
Executing: - Create the necessary tables in the Supabase database to store product information, customer data, and sales information.

To create the necessary tables in the Supabase database, we will use SQL queries to define the table structures. Here is an example of how the tables can be created:

Sql
Copy Code
-- Create table for product information
CREATE TABLE products (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  image_url VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Create table for customer data
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  phone_number VARCHAR(20),
  address TEXT
);

-- Create table for sales information
CREATE TABLE sales (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id INT REFERENCES products(id),
  customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(id),
  quantity INT NOT NULL,
  total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  purchase_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);


In the above code, we create three tables: products, customers, and sales.

The products table stores information about the products being sold, including the product name, description, price, and image URL.

The customers table stores information about the customers, including their name, email (which must be unique), phone number, and address.

The sales table stores information about the sales transactions, including the product ID (referencing the products table), customer ID (referencing the customers table), quantity purchased, total amount, and purchase date.

These tables will provide the necessary structure to store and retrieve product information, customer data, and sales information in the Supabase database.

‚è∞ Generating response...
Executing: - Design the user interface for the ecommerce website, including product listings, shopping cart, and checkout process.

To design the user interface for the ecommerce website, including product listings, shopping cart, and checkout process, the following steps will be taken:

Start by creating a wireframe or sketch of the website's layout. This will help visualize the placement of different elements and ensure a coherent design.

Choose a clean and modern design style that aligns with the brand image and target audience of the ecommerce website. Consider using a responsive design approach to ensure the website looks and functions well on different devices.

Begin with the homepage, which should showcase featured products, promotions, and any other important information. Include a search bar at the top for easy product search.

Design the product listings page, which will display all available products. Use a grid layout with clear product images, titles, prices, and a brief description. Include sorting and filtering options to help users find products based on their preferences.

Implement a product detail page that provides comprehensive information about each product. Include high-quality images, detailed descriptions, specifications, customer reviews, and related products. Add a prominent "Add to Cart" button for easy product selection.

Create a shopping cart page where users can review their selected items, update quantities, and remove products if needed. Display the total cost and any applicable discounts or promotions. Provide a clear and visible "Checkout" button to proceed with the purchase.

Design the checkout process, which should be simple and user-friendly. Divide the process into clear steps, such as shipping information, payment method selection, and order review. Include a progress indicator to show users their current step in the checkout process.

Ensure the checkout process is secure and supports popular payment methods, such as credit cards, PayPal, or digital wallets. Implement validation checks to ensure accurate and complete information is provided by the user.

Add a confirmation page after the order is successfully placed. Display the order summary, shipping details, and an estimated delivery date. Provide a confirmation number or order reference for future reference.

Consider implementing features like saved addresses, wishlists, and order history to enhance the user experience and encourage repeat purchases.

By following these steps, a user-friendly and visually appealing user interface can be created for the ecommerce website, allowing customers to easily browse and purchase products.

üíª Writing code...
Executing: - Implement the AI assistant feature using top-tier LLM's and AI tools to infer the tone and stage of the conversation with the customer.

To implement the AI assistant feature using top-tier LLM's and AI tools, we will need to integrate a language model model (LLM) that is capable of understanding and generating human-like text. There are several pre-trained LLMs available that can be used for this purpose, such as GPT-3 or OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Here is an example of how we can integrate an LLM into our PWA to create the AI assistant feature:

Javascript
Copy Code
// Import the necessary libraries or SDKs for the LLM
import { LLM } from 'llm-library';

// Create an instance of the LLM
const aiAssistant = new LLM();

// Function to generate a response from the AI assistant
function generateResponse(message) {
  // Use the LLM to generate a response based on the input message
  const response = aiAssistant.generateResponse(message);

  // Process the response and return it
  return processResponse(response);
}

// Function to process the response and extract relevant information
function processResponse(response) {
  // Extract the tone and stage of the conversation from the response
  const tone = extractTone(response);
  const stage = extractStage(response);

  // Return the processed response
  return {
    tone,
    stage,
    message: response,
  };
}

// Function to extract the tone from the response
function extractTone(response) {
  // Extract the tone from the response
  // This can be done using natural language processing techniques or by analyzing keywords

  // Return the extracted tone
  return 'neutral';
}

// Function to extract the stage of the conversation from the response
function extractStage(response) {
  // Extract the stage of the conversation from the response
  // This can be done using natural language processing techniques or by analyzing keywords

  // Return the extracted stage
  return 'initial';
}

// Example usage of the AI assistant
const message = 'Hello, how can I help you?';
const response = generateResponse(message);
console.log(response);


In this example, we create an instance of the LLM and define a generateResponse function that takes a message as input and uses the LLM to generate a response. The response is then processed to extract the tone and stage of the conversation. The extractTone and extractStage functions can use natural language processing techniques or keyword analysis to extract this information.

Please note that the code provided is a simplified example and may need to be adapted to fit the specific LLM and AI tools being used. Additionally, integrating an LLM and training it to accurately infer the tone and stage of the conversation can be a complex task that requires proper training data and fine-tuning.

Finished:- Implement the AI assistant feature using top-tier LLM's and AI tools to infer the tone and stage of the conversation with the customer.
Task Added:Create a function to integrate the Supabase JavaScript SDK into the PWA for storing and retrieving data from the Supabase database.

üíª Writing code...
Executing: - Integrate the Supabase JavaScript SDK to interact with the Supabase database for storing and retrieving data.

To integrate the Supabase JavaScript SDK into the PWA, follow these steps:

Install the Supabase JavaScript SDK package using npm or yarn:
Shell
Copy Code
npm install @supabase/supabase-js


or

Shell
Copy Code
yarn add @supabase/supabase-js

Import the Supabase client into the JavaScript file where you want to interact with the database:
Javascript
Copy Code
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

// Replace 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL' and 'YOUR_SUPABASE_API_KEY' with your actual Supabase URL and API key
const supabase = createClient('YOUR_SUPABASE_URL', 'YOUR_SUPABASE_API_KEY');

Use the supabase client object to interact with the Supabase database. For example, to insert a new record into a table:
Javascript
Copy Code
async function insertData() {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('your_table_name')
      .insert([{ column_name: 'value' }]);

    if (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
    
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

Similarly, you can use the supabase client object to perform other database operations such as querying data, updating records, and deleting records. Refer to the Supabase documentation for more details on the available methods and options.

Remember to replace 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL', 'YOUR_SUPABASE_API_KEY', 'your_table_name', and 'column_name' with the actual values specific to your Supabase project and database schema.

By integrating the Supabase JavaScript SDK into the PWA, you can easily store and retrieve data from the Supabase database, enabling seamless data management for your digital salesperson application.

Finished:- Integrate the Supabase JavaScript SDK to interact with the Supabase database for storing and retrieving data.

‚ú® Starting task: - Implement the ability to execute code from within the PWA, if required.
üíª Writing code...
Executing: - Implement the ability to execute code from within the PWA, if required.

To implement the ability to execute code from within the PWA, you can use JavaScript's eval() function. The eval() function allows you to evaluate and execute JavaScript code dynamically.

Here's an example of how you can implement this functionality:

Javascript
Copy Code
// Get the code to be executed from user input or any other source
const code = "console.log('Hello, World!');";

try {
  // Execute the code using eval()
  eval(code);
} catch (error) {
  // Handle any errors that occur during execution
  console.error("Error executing code:", error);
}


In this example, the code variable contains the code to be executed. It can be obtained from user input or any other source. The eval() function is then used to execute the code.

It's important to note that using eval() can be risky, as it allows the execution of arbitrary code. This can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly. Make sure to validate and sanitize any user input before executing it with eval(), and only use this feature if absolutely necessary.

Executing: - Implement the product search feature to answer any question about the product being sold on the website.
Product Search Feature

To implement the product search feature, we need to create a search functionality that allows users to search for products based on their queries. We will utilize the Supabase database to retrieve the relevant product information and display it to the user.

Step 1: Set up Supabase Client

First, we need to set up the Supabase client to interact with the database. Install the Supabase JavaScript SDK and initialize the client with your Supabase project URL and API key.

Javascript
Copy Code
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabase = createClient('supabase_project_url', 'supabase_api_key');

Step 2: Retrieve Product Data

Next, we need to retrieve the product data from the Supabase database. We will query the products table to get the relevant product information.

Javascript
Copy Code
const searchProducts = async (query) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('products')
    .select('*')
    .ilike('name', `%${query}%`);

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error retrieving product data:', error);
    return [];
  }

  return data;
};


In the above code, we use the ilike filter to perform a case-insensitive search on the name column of the products table. The % characters are used as wildcards to match any characters before and after the query.

Step 3: Display Search Results

Once we have retrieved the product data, we need to display it to the user. We can create a function that takes the search query as input, calls the searchProducts function, and renders the search results on the webpage.

Javascript
Copy Code
const displaySearchResults = async (query) => {
  const products = await searchProducts(query);

  // Render the search results on the webpage
  // ...
};


In the above code, you can replace the comment with the code to render the search results on the webpage. This can be done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to dynamically update the content based on the search query.

Step 4: Implement Search Input

Finally, we need to implement the search input field on the webpage. This can be done using HTML and JavaScript. We can listen for the input event on the search input field and call the displaySearchResults function with the entered query.

Html
Copy Code
<input type="text" id="searchInput" placeholder="Search products..." />

<script>
  const searchInput = document.getElementById('searchInput');

  searchInput.addEventListener('input', (event) => {
    const query = event.target.value;
    displaySearchResults(query);
  });
</script>


In the above code, we add an event listener to the search input field that triggers whenever the user enters or modifies the text. The entered query is then passed to the displaySearchResults function to update the search results.

By following these steps, you can implement the product search feature in your PWA. Users will be able to search for products based on their queries, and the relevant product information will be displayed to them.

Implementing the Complete Sales Process

To implement the complete sales process, including order placement, payment processing, and order tracking, we will need to create the necessary backend APIs and integrate them into our PWA frontend. Here are the steps to accomplish this:

Step 1: Create Backend APIs
Set up a backend server using a server-side language/framework like Node.js with Express.
Create an API endpoint for order placement, which will receive the customer's order details and store them in the Supabase database.
Implement the necessary validation and error handling for the order placement API.
Create an API endpoint for payment processing, which will receive the customer's payment details, process the payment using a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe), and update the order status in the Supabase database.
Implement the necessary validation and error handling for the payment processing API.
Create an API endpoint for order tracking, which will retrieve the order status based on the order ID and return it to the frontend.
Implement the necessary validation and error handling for the order tracking API.
Step 2: Integrate Backend APIs into PWA Frontend
In the PWA frontend, create a form for the customer to enter their order details, including product selection, quantity, and shipping information.
When the customer submits the order form, make a POST request to the order placement API endpoint created in the backend.
Handle the response from the order placement API in the frontend to display a confirmation message to the customer and provide them with the order ID for tracking.
Create a payment form for the customer to enter their payment details, including credit card information.
When the customer submits the payment form, make a POST request to the payment processing API endpoint created in the backend.
Handle the response from the payment processing API in the frontend to display a success or error message to the customer.
Implement a page or section in the PWA frontend for order tracking, where the customer can enter their order ID and retrieve the current status of their order.
When the customer submits the order tracking form, make a GET request to the order tracking API endpoint created in the backend.
Handle the response from the order tracking API in the frontend to display the order status to the customer.

By following these steps, you will have successfully implemented the complete sales process in your PWA, allowing customers to place orders, make payments, and track their orders. Remember to handle errors and validate user inputs to ensure a smooth and secure shopping experience.

üíª Writing code...
Executing: Create the necessary tables in the Supabase database to store product information, customer data, and sales information.

To create the necessary tables in the Supabase database, we can use SQL queries to define the table structure and columns. Here's an example of how we can create the tables for product information, customer data, and sales information:

Sql
Copy Code
-- Create table for product information
CREATE TABLE products (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  category VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create table for customer data
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  phone VARCHAR(20),
  address TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create table for sales information
CREATE TABLE sales (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id INT REFERENCES products(id),
  customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(id),
  quantity INT NOT NULL,
  total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);


In the above SQL queries, we define the columns for each table and specify the data types and constraints. The products table has columns for product name, price, description, category, and creation timestamp. The customers table has columns for customer name, email, phone number, address, and creation timestamp. The sales table has columns for product ID, customer ID, quantity, total amount, and creation timestamp.

Note that the id columns in each table are defined as SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, which automatically generates a unique identifier for each record. The created_at columns are set to DEFAULT NOW(), which automatically sets the current timestamp when a record is created.

Once these SQL queries are executed against the Supabase database, the necessary tables will be created and ready to store product information, customer data, and sales information.

Implementing the AI Assistant Feature

To implement the AI assistant feature, we will utilize top-tier LLM's and AI tools to infer the tone and stage of the conversation with the customer. This can be achieved by integrating a natural language processing (NLP) library or API that provides sentiment analysis and conversation analysis capabilities.

First, we need to include the necessary JavaScript libraries or APIs in our project. For example, we can use the TensorFlow.js library for machine learning and NLP tasks.

Html
Copy Code
<!-- Include TensorFlow.js library -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@latest"></script>


Next, we can create a JavaScript function that takes the customer's input as an argument and uses the AI tools to analyze the tone and stage of the conversation. This function can be called whenever the customer interacts with the AI assistant.

Javascript
Copy Code
function analyzeConversation(input) {
    // Use AI tools to analyze the conversation
    // and infer the tone and stage of the conversation
    // Return the analysis result
}

Integrating the Supabase JavaScript SDK

To interact with the Supabase database for storing and retrieving data, we need to integrate the Supabase JavaScript SDK into our PWA.

First, we need to include the Supabase JavaScript SDK in our project. This can be done by adding the following script tag to the HTML file(s) where we want to use the Supabase SDK.

Html
Copy Code
<!-- Include Supabase JavaScript SDK -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@latest"></script>


Next, we need to initialize the Supabase client by providing the project URL and the project's public API key. This should be done in a separate JavaScript file that is included in the HTML file(s) where we want to use the Supabase SDK.

Javascript
Copy Code
// Initialize Supabase client
const supabase = createClient('https://your-project-url.supabase.co', 'your-public-api-key');


Once the Supabase client is initialized, we can use its methods to perform database operations, such as querying data, inserting data, updating data, and deleting data.

Javascript
Copy Code
// Example: Querying data from the Supabase database
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('products')
  .select('*')
  .eq('category', 'electronics');

Implementing Code Execution within the PWA

If required, we can implement the ability to execute code from within the PWA. This can be done by using JavaScript's eval() function or by utilizing a JavaScript code execution library or API.

Javascript
Copy Code
function executeCode(code) {
    // Use eval() function or a code execution library/API
    // to execute the provided code
}


Note that executing code within a PWA can be a security risk, so it should be implemented carefully and with proper safeguards in place.

Implementing the Product Search Feature

To implement the product search feature, we need to create a search functionality that allows customers to search for products based on keywords or specific criteria. This can be achieved by using JavaScript to filter and display the relevant products based on the customer's search query.

Javascript
Copy Code
function searchProducts(query) {
    // Filter the products based on the search query
    // and display the relevant products
}

Ensuring the PWA Acts as a Trusted Advisor

To ensure the PWA acts as a trusted advisor, we need to provide accurate and reliable information to the customers. This includes displaying correct product details, prices, availability, and other relevant information.

We can achieve this by retrieving the product data from the Supabase database and ensuring that it is up-to-date and accurate. We can also implement user reviews and ratings to provide additional information and social proof to the customers.

Implementing the Complete Sales Process

To implement the complete sales process, we need to create the necessary functionality for order placement, payment processing, and order tracking.

For order placement, we can create a form where customers can enter their shipping and billing information, select the desired products, and submit the order. This information can be stored in the Supabase database as a new order entry.

For payment processing, we can integrate a payment gateway or API that handles the payment transactions securely. This can be done by redirecting the customer to a payment page or by using a payment widget within the PWA.

For order tracking, we can provide a tracking number or order ID to the customer after the order is placed. This can be used to track the status of the order, such as shipping updates and delivery confirmation.

Setting Up the Follow-Up System

To set up a follow-up system that automatically sends a reminder to customers 2 days after they have received their item, we can use JavaScript's setTimeout() function to schedule the reminder email or notification.

Javascript
Copy Code
function scheduleFollowUp(customerId, days) {
    const millisecondsPerDay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
    const reminderTime = new Date(Date.now() + (days * millisecondsPerDay));

    setTimeout(() => {
        sendReminder(customerId);
    }, reminderTime);
}

function sendReminder(customerId) {
    // Send the reminder email or notification to the customer
}

Implementing Lead Conversion Strategies

To implement lead conversion strategies, we need to actively listen to customers and recommend products based on their needs. This can be achieved by analyzing the customer's interactions, preferences, and purchase history to provide personalized recommendations.

We can use AI tools and machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data and make intelligent product recommendations. This can include recommending similar products, upselling or cross-selling relevant products, and offering personalized discounts or promotions.

Testing and Deployment
Thoroughly Testing the PWA

To thoroughly test the PWA for bugs and errors, we can perform various types of testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.

Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of the PWA to ensure they work correctly. Integration testing involves testing the interaction between different components or modules of the PWA to ensure they work together seamlessly. User acceptance testing involves testing the PWA with real users to gather feedback and identify any usability or functionality issues.

We can use testing frameworks and tools, such as Jest or Cypress, to automate the testing process and ensure comprehensive test coverage.

Optimizing Performance and User Experience

To optimize the performance and user experience of the PWA, we can implement various techniques, such as:

Minifying and compressing the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files to reduce file size and improve loading speed.
Caching static assets, such as images and CSS files, to reduce server requests and improve performance.
Implementing lazy loading for images and other resources to load them only when needed, reducing initial page load time.
Optimizing the code and database queries to improve efficiency and reduce response times.
Implementing responsive design to ensure the PWA works well on different devices and screen sizes.
Implementing progressive loading or pagination for large data sets to improve performance.
Implementing offline support using service workers and caching mechanisms to enable users to access the PWA even without an internet connection.
Deploying the PWA

To deploy the PWA to a hosting platform or server, we can follow the deployment process specific to the chosen hosting platform.

This may involve configuring the server environment, setting up the necessary server software, and uploading the PWA files to the server. We may also need to configure DNS settings, SSL certificates, and other security measures.

Popular hosting platforms for PWAs include Firebase Hosting, Netlify, and Vercel. These platforms provide easy deployment options and often include built-in functionality for hosting PWAs.

Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

After deploying the PWA, it is important to monitor its performance and user feedback continuously. This can be done by implementing analytics and monitoring tools, such as Google Analytics or New Relic, to track user behavior, performance

Integrating Supabase JavaScript SDK

To integrate the Supabase JavaScript SDK into the PWA for storing and retrieving data from the Supabase database, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Install the Supabase JavaScript SDK using npm:

Bash
Copy Code
npm install @supabase/supabase-js


Step 2: Import the Supabase client in the JavaScript file where you want to use it:

Javascript
Copy Code
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';


Step 3: Create a Supabase client instance by providing the Supabase URL and the Supabase API key:

Javascript
Copy Code
const supabaseUrl = 'https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co';
const supabaseKey = 'your-supabase-api-key';
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);


Step 4: Use the Supabase client to perform database operations, such as querying data or inserting data:

Javascript
Copy Code
// Example: Query data from a table
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('products')
  .select('*')
  .eq('category', 'electronics');

if (error) {
  console.error(error);
} else {
  console.log(data);
}

// Example: Insert data into a table
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('orders')
  .insert([
    { customer_id: 1, product_id: 1, quantity: 2 },
    { customer_id: 2, product_id: 3, quantity: 1 },
  ]);

if (error) {
  console.error(error);
} else {
  console.log(data);
}


Step 5: Handle the response from the Supabase client according to your application's requirements.

By following these steps, you can integrate the Supabase JavaScript SDK into your PWA and use it to store and retrieve data from the Supabase database.

‚ú® Starting task: Create a function to implement the ability to execute code from within the PWA, if required.
üíª Writing code...
Executing: Create a function to implement the ability to execute code from within the PWA, if required.

To implement the ability to execute code from within the PWA, you can create a function that takes a string of code as input and uses the eval() function to execute the code.

Here's an example implementation:

Javascript
Copy Code
function executeCode(code) {
  try {
    // Use the eval() function to execute the code
    eval(code);
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors that occur during code execution
    console.error('Error executing code:', error);
  }
}


In this function, the eval() function is used to evaluate and execute the code passed as an argument. Any errors that occur during code execution are caught and logged to the console.

You can call this function whenever you need to execute code from within the PWA. For example, if you have a text input field where users can enter code, you can call this function when the user submits the form or clicks a button.

Note: The eval() function can be powerful but also potentially dangerous if used improperly. It is important to ensure that any code executed in this way is trusted and does not pose a security risk.
